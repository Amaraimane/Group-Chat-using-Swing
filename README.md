## Group-Chat-using-Swing
Group Chat Application in Java using Swing and Caesar Cipher Encryption. Great Example of Client Server Model and End-to-End Encryption.<br>
## Prerequisite
JVM<br>
## To Run
First clone the repository 
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jatanrathod/Group-Chat-using-Swing.git
```
Now, run the server.java from server/src/server/ on one machine and Client.java on other Machine.<br>
You require ip address of the server machine to put it in the socket object of 'client.java' in client/src/client/ <br>
Now, run the client on another machine.<br>
It will work better with any Java IDE like Netbeans, eclipse, etc.
Done. :)
